# Project Summary

## Overview of Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
This project is primarily developed using Java for the backend and JavaScript (with React) for the frontend. The backend is built using the Spring framework, which is evident from the presence of Java files structured in a typical Spring Boot application format. The frontend utilizes React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, along with Vite as the build tool. 

Key components include:
- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript (React)
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot (for backend), React (for frontend)
- **Main Libraries**: 
  - Spring Framework (for backend)
  - React (for frontend)
  - Vite (for frontend build tool)
  - ESLint (for JavaScript code linting)

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project appears to be the development of a web application that likely involves user management functionalities, such as registration and login, as suggested by the presence of components like `Login.jsx` and `Register.jsx`. The backend is set up to handle student-related data, indicating that the application may be focused on student management or educational purposes.
